# Smart Weather Helper

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI assistant that suggests what clothes to wear based on the current weather in your city. Perfect for parents, busy students, and anyone who wants help choosing the right outfit every day.

## Background

Many people struggle with knowing what to wear when the weather changes unexpectedly. This is especially true in places like Sweden. This project aims to reduce that daily stress by giving outfit suggestions based on local weather data.

## How is it used?

The user visits a web page or app, enters a location, and receives suggestions like:
- "Bring an umbrella"
- "Wear a warm jacket"
- "Sunscreen recommended"

## Data sources and AI methods

Weather data from OpenWeatherMap API  
Rule-based logic for clothing suggestions  
(Optional: Machine Learning in future versions)

## Challenges

Personal preferences vary (e.g., some people feel cold faster). Also, extreme conditions may require more complex advice.

## What next?

Create a mobile app version  
Add personalization by learning user preferences  
Use image recognition to scan user wardrobe
